# Professional README Generator

## Project Description
This project project utilized a couple different languages and dependicies to become operational. First the index.js file was created calling on our  dependencies inquirer, path, fs, and a file created later generateMarkdown. This file needed to contain the prompts that would appear in the users terminal. After this functions to write the file and initialize the app. Once this was taken care of the Markdown was tackled. The information input from the prompt questions will be dynamically inserted into the MarkDown language. This is a handy tool when a user needs a README generated quickly for a project. 

While working through this project I learned how to dynamically insert information, and obtained greater understanding of how much functions call accomplish.
